## injurpediaDB

A full-stack web application utilizing Node.js, React, and MySQL with complete CRUD functionality. The app serves as an interface for data tables, the primary user being the administrator of the database. This project will support a website that offers user-friendly recovery guides for adults with non-life threatening injuries. Injurpedia will store guides for approximately ~80 common injuries. To effectively categorize injuries for guide selection, six body parts (head, neck, chest, abdomen, arm, leg) will be divided into approximately ~24 SubParts. End users will have the option to track their injuries and healing progress.
